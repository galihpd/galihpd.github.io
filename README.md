## Hello This Is My Github Pages Source

Private WEB open to the public. It contains a resume & portfolio of 3D & design artwork, coursework & study / exploration. Just for fun maybe it can be a reference ðŸ˜‚

I'm currently trying to graduate from the Digital Multimedia Engineering (vocational) study program. Understand graphic design, Coding, a little 3D, Basic computer security, Network && anything anywayðŸ˜‚ Those who want to chat can contact me at galihpr@aol.com.

I can install computer networks, especially those using UTP, can code but console like bash and C++ shells, can also design, especially design feeds for social media posts like Instagram and Twitter, can also take pictures, the important thing is that the camera can be fully manual and still learning 3D modeling whose results can be seen here. I got more or less the above experience 4 years ago, when I started high school
